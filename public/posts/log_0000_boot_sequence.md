## The Design Philosophy

This isn't a blog or a personal site. This is me pulling cables out of my brain and wiring them into a screen. You're inside a **system** I built.

This interface, this blur, the boot prompt vibe? They're what my mind looks like when it finally stops pretending. They are symptoms disguised as design choices.

Symptoms of what you might ask?
Symptoms of a brain that couldn't sit still.  
Symptoms of someone who didn't want to make content but needed to **make contact**.

I tried blending in. Really. Tried my best.

I made systems. Wrote product specs. Most importantly? I innovated.
I smiled in meetings where everyone was allergic to hard questions.
But under all of that, I was yelling into a terminal only I could see.

Now you see it too.

## System Specifications & Tech Stack

This isn't a portfolio.

This is a scratch disk for my playground.
Logs. Refactors. Burnt code and sharper thoughts.

Built on React for component modularity, but bypassing the Virtual DOM for the background engine to ensure raw 60FPS Canvas performance.

```javascript
[ WHATS RUNNING UNDER THE HOOD? ]
- React (Custom Component Architecture)
- No CSS Frameworks
- Custom markdown engine (No Database)
- Procedural background generation engine built on HTML5 Canvas (No WebGL libraries)
- Easter Egg (yes, find it)
- PDF resume viewer with theme sync (you're welcome)
```

But more than that, this is the thing I couldn't *not* build.


I didn't build this site to get hired.  
I built it because it wouldn't leave me tf alone.

People talk about "standing out".
I'm not trying to stand out. I'm here to stop erasing myself.

This site fits me. So I made it.
If this fits someone else too? Cool.
But I'm not gonna shrink it to fit an algorithm.

## Why the Terminal vibe?

Because my thoughts start at a prompt.  
Because I've always seen life as a system.
One that you can boot, crash, override, or just observe.
Or, maybe because I spent a long time typing "**run exit**" hoping it would end something,
but sometimes it just shows you exactly where you are.

```bash
npm run logs:flush
cd help  
curiosity deploy  
```

## What even is this Website?

This isn't a writing platform. It's a logging system.
Custom markdown. Wired to my mental model.
Letting me say things exactly how they show up in my head.

No ads. No listicles. No SEO voodoo.
Just raw logs.

Some clean. Some broken.
But all of them honest.

**Why I built it like this?**
Because my brain needed a space that *felt* like how it thinks.

### Ghost from the past

![Sample Image](https://cdn.ujjwalvivek.com/posts/media/old_website_haunted.webp)

old screenshot. still haunts me. this was the state of this website for a little over two summer. it took me two summers to become someone who could finish it.

:::warning
This site is still booting

Things will glitch. Some commands won't work.  That's part of the ritual.
:::


## No Analytics. No Cookies. No Noise.

This site doesn't track you.  
No tracking. No popups. No KPIs.
Just thoughts.

You read something and it sticks? Awesome.
If not, that's fine too.

I'll still be here, typing.
Because silence is brutal,
but not building is worse.

## Why This Took Two Years

Because I wasn't ready to finish it.

Tech-wise? I had the chops.
Creatively? Plenty of ideas.
But mentally? I kept ghosting my own builds.

I bought this domain two years ago.
A different me, hungry to build, but addicted to the idea of building more than the work itself.

Tried Gatsby. Next. papermod. Clones of sites I didn't even like.
Kept quitting halfway.

Sparse commits.
Long silences.
Imposter syndrome disguised as "I'm still experimenting".
"Coming soon... maybe" was starting to become the most honest thing I ever ship.

And slowly, that started to hurt.
Not because of some fake deadline.
But because abandoned builds taught my brain:

> "You don't finish things."

I didn't want to be that guy anymore.
So I pushed. Not because it's perfect, but because it's mine.

This is a **two-year transformation log** disguised as a terminal vibe.

```javascript
> deploy  
[ WARN ] site has unfinished logs  
[ CONTINUE? ] y  
[ PUSHING... ]
```

---

I built this thing in bursts and breakdowns.
Console.log and caffeine.

I almost didn't ship.
Because when you ship something this personal,
you can't hide anymore.

Buut maybe, that's been the whole point.

So here we are.

```bash
> logs=/[
{ label: "Jun '25", event: "Terminal site prototype booted" },
{ label: "Jul '25", event: "ujjwalvivek.com goes live" }
]
```
