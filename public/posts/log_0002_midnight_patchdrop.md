## Building My Site Was The Real Rollercoaster

If you've ever tried to make your website look "cool" with animated backgrounds, you know the pain. I started with a simple goal: make my site pop. What followed was a wild ride through browser quirks, overheating phones, the bleeding edge of web graphics, and an insightful launch.<br><br>Not that I was any stranger to web graphics, but `webGPU` still intimidated me.

## Enter Social Platforms

**Deployed v1.0** <br>Dropped it on a few subs, dev.to, x (Twittwer) <br>People showed up. <br><br>Didn't hold back. 

> "The animation gave me a headache." <br> <br>"Why is my browser screaming?" <br> <br>"Animations resets every visit. Please. My eyes." <br> <br>"Cool idea but it's cooking my phone." <br> <br>"Cant see shit, navigation is weird"

And... Thank you really! <br>Because this was the first time anyone actually ***used*** it.

## So I Planned For v1.1 Release On A Friday Midnight

So that I self sabotage my weekend plans? <br>Human brain is weird. <br>Not really. <br>But out of **respect** for the people who showed up; I patched.

### Here's Some Highlights 

#### Performance Improvements

![webGPU](/posts/media/webgpu.svg)
`{the above svg is a prime example of how webkit doesnt play nice with anything.}`


I had recently discovered WebGPU, the new graphics API that lets you use the power of your graphics card.<br><br>It was like opening another secret door. The other one being webGL. That piece of tech still amazes me. <br><br>Trust me, I did not know what I was getting myself into. <br>The catch? WebGPU is new, and the documentation is… let's say "adventurous".<br><br>I couldnt rewrite my generator logic as shaders, yet.<br>

````javascript
I tried:
- Low Quality. Low Particle Density. Made wallpapers blurry.
- Tweaking numbers, understanding canvas optimizations
- Tried device detection, just to give their device a fighting chance.
- Throttle animation loops so they do not run faster than needed. 
- Reduce drawing complexity, and canvas resolution for mobile devices.
- Pause Animations when off focus (saving battery and heat).
````
Sources:
[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Optimizing_canvas)

After a lot of trial and error (and a few existential crises), I got it working. My generators now run ~~buttery~~ smooth, even on mobile. It pulses, it moves, and my phone doesn't melt. Probably yours wont too. 

::::note
FPS capped at ~20/~30, enough for a smooth viewing experience <br><br>No resource hogging. No random heatups. Probably. <br><br>All while still being CPU-bound. For now. <br><br>WebGPU is something to look forward to. **A great success!**
::::

#### Low Chaos Mode™

What about folks who get dizzy from motion? <br>Some users need less motion, more contrast, or just a calmer vibe.  <br><br>So I reduced motion detection accompanied by a zen-like **Low Chaos Mode™**. <br>No animations. No glitchiness. Just pure calm.

````javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (prefersReducedMotion && !showPrompt) {
        window.alert(
            "Accessibility Notice:\n\nWe detected your system prefers reduced motion. Some backgrounds and animations may cause discomfort. For a calmer experience, consider enabling Low Chaos Mode."
        );
        setShowPrompt(true);
    }
}, [prefersReducedMotion, showPrompt]);
````

Reads `prefers-reduced-motion`, shows a low chaos mode™ prompt. Accessibility Gods, I see you

````javascript
        useEffect(() => {
        if (prefersReducedMotion && backgroundConfig.isAnimated) {
            setBackgroundConfig(prev => ({
                ...prev,
                isAnimated: false,
            }));
        }
    }, [prefersReducedMotion, backgroundConfig.isAnimated]);
````

Accessibility isn't optional. <br>A simple prompt can make a big difference. <br>Respect your users. If they want less motion, give them less motion. <br><br>And **Low Chaos Mode™** is now my favorite button.   <br><br>*(Also, don't test animated backgrounds on a 2015 laptop.or do. and pls let me know how that goes.)*

#### Less chaos on load, more chaos by design

* **Better Readability:**
    You can read text now. Probably. Maybe.
    Also, **Canvas blur on Safari is... better?** Let's pretend

* **Animations states are now saved in the configuration across navigation**: Sorry to that one guy who probably sat and watched it roll atleast 10 times.

* **`pdfjs`'s UI looked like Windows 98:** Now it fits the vibe™.

## Stuff That Broke My Brain

#### `requestAnimationFrame` stuttering like dial-up a staircase?

getting that smooth 30fps was a PITA.

#### iPads reporting as Macintosh on safari

How ironical. <br><br>Always combine user agent checks with feature detection (like 'ontouchstart' in window or navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1).<br><br>This way, you can reliably identify iPads even when they lie about being a Mac. <br><br>**In short:** <br>Don’t trust the user agent alone. Check for touch capability too!

````javascript
const isMobile = useMemo(() => {
if (typeof navigator === "undefined" || typeof window === "undefined") return false;
const ua = navigator.userAgent;
const isIpad = (
    /iPad/.test(ua) ||
    (ua.includes("Macintosh") && ('ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1))
);
const isIphoneOrAndroid = /iPhone|iPod|Android/i.test(ua);
return isIphoneOrAndroid || isIpad;
}, []);
````

### But Hey, Some Wins

* Found out that WebGPU is real… and terrifying
* Learned that accessibility isn't just a checkbox. 
* Other Accessibility features planned for future. Inclusivity is cool.
* My phone no longer becomes a stove. And maybe yours too.  
* The **Low Chaos Mode™** button is my personal chill pill.
* Custom vibes for every mood.

### So What's Next?

\-- v1.0 was chaos unleashed. <br>\-- v1.1 is chaos *tamed*; juust a little. <br>\-- v1.2? v2.0? <br>\-- No roadmap yet, but definetely migration to **webGPU** would be my next thing to crack.

::::note
**Try exploring around.<br>It still glitches. It still talks back.<br><br>But now? It listens a little too.**
