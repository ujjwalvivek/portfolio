# Stepping Stones — Ujjwal Vivek's Portfolio & Builder's Log

Welcome to my corner of the web.  
I build, break, and rebuild systems — across code, teams, and products.  
From VR platforms to Rust game engines, this journey is logged.

## Philosophy

- **Tech isn't the hard part.**  
  Systems, behaviour, and questions are.
- **Transparency > Perfection.**  
  You'll find unfinished thoughts, failed experiments, and the occasional breakthrough.
- **Source ≠ Product.**  
  This repo is public, not open. Steal ideas, not identity.

## What's Inside

- ✍️ **Blog:** Deep dives, war stories, and technical rants.  
- 🖥️ **Terminal Footer:** The site talks back. Try typing `run exit` or `cat` in the footer.
- 📄 **Resume:** PDF viewer with light/dark mode.
- 🛠️ **Stack:** React, Rust, Markdown, custom CSS, and a sprinkle of terminal magic.

## Running Locally

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## Folder Structure

- `/src` — React components, pages, and terminal logic
- `/public/posts` — Markdown blog posts
- `/public/ideas.md` — Future logs and drafts

## Contributing

This is a personal log, not a community project.  
But if you spot a bug or want to say hi, open an issue or drop a message.

## License

Source-available.  
Read, learn, remix — but don't clone the soul.

Happy building.
