# The Terminal That Talks Back

Welcome, wanderer.

You’ve booted into a system built from fragments, logs, code, and questions.  
This isn’t a portfolio. It’s a ritual.  
I build, break, and rebuild systems, across code, teams, and products.  
From VR platforms to Rust game engines, this journey is logged.
Every page, a prompt. Every glitch, a memory.  


## Philosophy

- **Tech isn't the hard part.**  
  Systems, behaviour, and questions are.
- **Transparency > Perfection.**  
  You'll find unfinished thoughts, failed experiments, and the occasional breakthrough.
- **Source ≠ Product.**  
  This repo is public and open. *Steal* ideas, not identity.

## What's Inside

- ✍️ **Blog:** A markdown engine that renders thoughts as commands..  
- 🖥️ **Easter Egg:** The site talks back. Try out some commands when you come across it.
- 💃 **Vibe:** Procedural backgrounds, born from chaos and tamed for clarity..
- 🛠️ **Stack:** React, Markdown, custom CSS, and a sprinkle of terminal magic.

> Logs of failures, launches, and the silence between.

No analytics. No popups. No noise.  
Just a builder’s log, still compiling.

## Running Locally

```sh
cd $Home_Folder
npm install
npm run start
```

## Folder Structure

- `/src` — React components, pages, and everything logic
- `/public/posts` — Markdown blog posts, raw
- `/public/_dump.md` — Future logs and drafts, and mostly dumps
