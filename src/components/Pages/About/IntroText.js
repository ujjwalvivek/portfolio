# I build, break, and rebuild systems across code, teams, and products.
# From VR platforms to Rust game engines, this journey is logged.

  → PM, but always thought like a systems engineer
  → shipped MVPs
  → built VR platforms
  → automated ops pipelines
  → currently writing a Rust-powered game engine (that may blow up this site)

  [!] fired 3 times — not for underperforming, but for not staying quiet
  [✓] still asking the hard questions
  [✓] still building
  [✓] still believing in work that matters
