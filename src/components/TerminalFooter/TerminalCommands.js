[ SYSTEM BOOTING... ]
A faint glow hums on the terminal.

>> Type 'wake'
`
  },

    trigger: "wake",
    output: `
You awaken.

Somewhere between code and consciousness.

You see fragments. Logs. Memories. Systems you once trusted.

One fragment pulses softly: 'follow'

>> Type 'follow'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "follow",
    output: `
The fragment becomes a door labeled:

[ UNKNOWN / YOU ]

A riddle appears:
"I am the end of all beginnings,
and the beginning of all ends."

>> Type 'e', or 'ask', or 'ignore'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "e",
    output: `
ACCESS GRANTED.

The door opens into silence.

>> Type 'decrypt'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "ask",
    output: `
You ask: "Who wrote this riddle?"

The door flickers.

A voice replies:
"You did."

>> Type 'e' or 'ignore'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "ignore",
    output: `
You turn away.

The terminal dims.

But the prompt still lingers...

>> Type 'e'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "decrypt",
    output: `
Encrypted thoughts scroll across the screen.

Regrets. Versions. Untitled drafts.

Suddenly, a flashing prompt:
"INTRUDER DETECTED."

>> Type 'escape' or 'accept'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "escape",
    output: `
You run through recursive corridors.

The system glitches. You hear yourself thinking.

A message flickers:
"THIS LOOP HAS BEEN RUN BEFORE."

>> Type 'shutdown'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "accept",
    output: `
You sit still.

Letting the warnings pass.

No alarms. No running.

Just... stillness.

>> Type 'reflect' or 'escape'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "reflect",
    output: `
You begin to wonder:
Was this simulation really trying to trap you?

Or show you something?

...

>> Type 'run exit' or 'loop'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "loop",
    output: `
The story begins again.

But you remember this place.

And this time, the questions feel heavier.

>> Type 'wake'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "shutdown",
    output: `
System override denied.

Too many variables.

Too many unknowns.

A final prompt remains:

>> Type 'run exit', or 'wait', or 'retry'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "retry",
    output: `
Override failed.

The system laughs.

You can't brute-force truth.

>> Type 'run exit'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "wait",
    output: `
You wait.

And wait.

And the silence grows louder than the code ever was.

...

>> Type 'run exit' or 'reflect'
`
  },
  {
    trigger: "dream",
    output: `
You let go of the keyboard.

And close your eyes.

And for a moment, you remember something that never happened.

...

A hollow voice says: "Nothing happens."

But deep down... something shifted.

    output: `
Code stretches infinitely.

But the answers aren't out there.

You hum a broken tune in binary.

Somehow, it comforts you.
